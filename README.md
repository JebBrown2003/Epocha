# Epocha
A futuristic, theoretical framework for a data storage system that expands capacity by sending and retrieving information through controlled points in time.

### Features

- Time-forward multiplexed data storage
- Error-correcting codes integrated for robustness
- Distributed consensus to handle noisy or missing data
- Priority-based data cycling for efficient storage management
- Modular design allowing prototyping in Python and optimization in lower-level languages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (for prototyping)
- [Optional] Rust or C/C++ compiler (for optimized modules)

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/JebBrown2003/Epocha.git
cd Epocha
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```
from timebit import TimebitStorage

storage = TimebitStorage(slot_duration_ms=100)
storage.store(data=0b1101)
retrieved = storage.retrieve()
print(f"Retrieved data: {retrieved}")
```

## Architecture

- Time-forward messaging interface: Abstracts sending/receiving data points into/from the future
- Error correction module: Encodes/decodes data with ECC (e.g., Hamming, Reed-Solomon)
- Consensus layer: Coordinates multiple receivers for data validation
- Priority algorithm: Manages which data to send/store next to optimize space usage
